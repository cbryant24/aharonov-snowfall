          Whether Collaborating with renowned colleagues or brainstorming on the fly, the award-winning physicist runs
          big
          ideas into quantum breakthroughs.
        </p>

    <section class="aharonov-effect__article-content">
      <p>Yakir Aharonov never stops thinking – deeply, imaginatively, fearlessly – about the
        strange, rich and often shocking foundations of the universe. “I think in my sleep. I wake up with
        new answers every morning,” says the distinguished professor of theoretical physics and co-
        director of the Institute for Quantum Studies (IQS) at Chapman University. “Even while I’m
        talking to you right now, my mind continues to work on new ideas.”</p>
      <p>It’s a sunny summer morning. Aharonov has made time for a phone interview as he and a
        group of internationally prominent colleagues finish breakfast and drive to Chapman’s campus in
        Orange for a day of lively quantum conversation. A National Medal of Science winner,
        Aharonov has discovered dozens of fundamental physics effects, changing the quantum
        landscape, igniting controversies and winning converts along the way.
      </p>
      <p>Nobel Laureate and IQS member Sir Anthony Leggett, Ph.D., characterizes the work of

          Yakir Aharonov never stops thinking – deeply, imaginatively, fearlessly –
          about the
          strange, rich and often shocking foundations of the universe.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Nobel Laureate and IQS member Sir Anthony Leggett, Ph.D., characterizes
        the work of Aharonov and the Institute as among the “major revolutions in
        the history of physics – and I mean really major revolutions like Copernicus,
        Galileo, Einstein.”</p>
      <p>Among Aharonov’s most significant discoveries: Time can flow backward.
        Subatomic particles are altered by distant forces. Blips of matter can be
        separated from their properties, much like Alice in Wonderland’s Cheshire
        Cat and its spooky grin. And two particles can – somehow – be linked across
        wide expanses of space.</p>
      <p>Mind-bending concepts, all. But Aharonov’s amazing discoveries are
        routinely proved correct by experimental physicists. (“This isn’t airy-fairy
        philosophy – these are real experiments,” Arizona State University
        cosmologist Paul Davies, Ph.D, told Discover magazine, admiringly, of
        Aharonov’s work.) And Aharonov’s ideas – particularly an important
        experimental technique called weak measurement -- are now deployed by
        other scientists every day to explore new corners of the quantum realm.</p>
      <p>“Yakir is arguably one of the very best theoretical quantum physicists alive,”
        says Chapman President Daniele Struppa, Ph.D, a professor of mathematics.
        “His impact in physics has been tremendous. What is extraordinary about
        Yakir is the fact that he has built on his most famous work – the
        Aharonov-Bohm Effect of 1959 – to make more and more exciting
        discoveries. He has reformulated quantum mechanics in a totally novel way,
        thus offering a new way to predict the singular behavior of quantum
        systems.”</p>
      <p>In general, physics research has yielded an array of societal benefits, from
        electricity to satellites and smartphones. Quantum theory provides a model
        of nature that explains how matter and energy behave at the atomic and
        subatomic levels. It has led to breakthroughs in electronics, lasers and
        computers.</p>

        <figcaption>Yakir Aharonovʼs quantum contri-
          butions have earned him a host of

          awards, including the National
          Medial of Science in 2010 from
          President Barack Obama, who

          called him “one of the most influ-
          ential figures in modern physics.”</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“We’re finding that this is a good time and we are in a good positon to make
        rapid progress in a number of important areas, including quantum sensing,
        which has applications for radar and detecting small gravitational fields.”
        says Matthew Leifer, Ph.D., co-director of the Institute for Quantum Studies.</p>
      <p>Thanks to his quantum contributions, the 87-year-old Aharonov, with a mop
        of silver-white hair and a penchant for cigars and punchline stories, has been
        short-listed for the Nobel Prize. That’s in addition to receiving the National
        Medal of Science in 2010 from President Barack Obama, who called him
        “one of the most influential figures in modern physics.” What’s more,
        Aharonov was elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences and
        was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics, one of the most prestigious honors in
        the field. Aharonov’s full list of awards includes the Weizmann Prize, the
        Rothschild Award, the Israel Prize in Physics and the Hewlett-Packard
        Europhysics Prize.</p>
      <p>Aharonov is so well known in his native Israel that the influential national
        newspaper Haaretz wishes him well on his birthday, Aug. 28. And some of his
        more than 200 published papers have been covered by popular-science
        magazines and daily newspapers, including Discover Magazine, New
        Scientist, Scientific American, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
        “Yakir has been making important discoveries for the last 65 years,” says Jeff
        Tollaksen, Ph.D, founder and co-director of the IQS. “People keep saying,
        ‘Oh come on, that one can’t be true,’ but his many discoveries have been
        verified in experiments over and over again. I don’t know of any other
        scientist with that kind of track record, especially one who’s asking the really
        big questions the way Yakir is. His team just keeps hitting home runs.”</p>
      <h3 class="aharonov_effect__article-subheading">LABORATORY OF THE MIND</h3>
      <p>At Chapman, Aharonov’s influence is stretching further and further into the
        quantum world – and far into the future. He’s teaching a new generation of
        physicists at the Institute for Quantum Studies, and he collaborates with
        leading scientists from Chapman and around the globe.</p>
      <p>“Thirteen years ago, Chapman had no physics department. Today we have a
        department, the institute and we have attracted incredible faculty, visiting
        professors from around the world and students – undergraduates, graduate
        students and post-docs – because of Yakir,” Struppa said. “His influence
        extends beyond physics. Dr. Amir Raz became interested in Chapman after
        talking with Yakir. He founded the university’s new Institute for
        Interdisciplinary Brain and Behavioral Sciences as a result.”</p>
      <p>In addition, Aharonov’s big ideas have the potential for real-world
        applications such as powerful quantum computers, super-sensitive sensors,
        stronger lasers and microscopes capable of discerning some of the
        universe’s tiniest objects. “Laboratories are using his ideas and developing
        new technologies with them,” Struppa says.</p>
      <p>Formerly a professor of physics at Tel Aviv University, the University of South
        Carolina and George Mason University, Aharonov joined the Chapman
        faculty in 2008. “I’ve found complete freedom to do whatever I like in physics
        and have people around me to discuss it with – including Jeff Tollaksen and
        Daniele Struppa,” he says. “I have a lot of encouragement to think about my
        foundational work. And through the Institute, I can share my ideas with
        scientists from all over the world. We are making exciting new discoveries all
        the time. This drives me to keep going.”</p>

      <p>July’s informal gathering of major physicists included Sandu Popescu, Ph.D.,
        a pioneer of quantum information. “We brainstorm 20 hours a day for two
        weeks,” Tollaksen says. “It’s a very creative time.”
      </p>
      <p>In the room there’s always the theorist’s must-have equipment – a chalk
        board, which is preferable to a white board because it’s easier to erase,
        Tollaksen notes. “But we are not immersed in equations and numbers alone,”
        he says. “Yakir’s method is conducting thought experiments – the
        Gedankenexperiments famously used by Albert Einstein.”
      </p>
      <p>Aharonov used the technique extensively as a graduate student at the
        University of Bristol, England, where his advisor was the renowned
        theoretical physicist David Bohm, who had worked closely with Einstein.
        “Gedankenexperiments are the gold standard for making new discoveries,”
        Tollaksen explains. “We focus on a paradox, a point where two existing
        theories intersect but don’t seem to fit together. We use our intuition to
        come up with new ideas that are provable. The technique has fallen out of
        practice in science. One of our missions is to re-introduce it at Chapman and
        more widely. We believe this method can serve as a paradigm for teaching in
        general.”

        Over more than 65 years of research, Gedankenexperiments have
        yielded many important new discoveries for Aharonov. One of the most
        significant is the Aharonov-Bohm Effect, which found that particles can be
        affected by forces located far away. It’s hailed as one of the major quantum
        theory discoveries of the second half of the 20th century. Other complex
        discoveries named for Yakir and his collaborators include The
        Aharonov-Casher Effect (1984), the Aharonov-Anandan Geometric Phase
        (1987) and the Quantum Random Walk (1993).

                  In a 1964 paper, Aharonov and colleagues showed that the future reaches back in time and meddles with
                  the past. “We looked at two atoms, identical at the beginning but different at the end of the
                  experiment,” Aharonov notes. “We theorized that the future tells us something new about the system

                <p class="theory-description">
                  Quantum physicists have long lamented that the act of observing
                  subatomic particles changes their behavior. In 1988, Aharonov and his team proposed essentially
                  spying on them, with tiny “weak” measurements. The little glimpses made in the dark must be
                  made thousands of times but add up to solid evidence that’s allowed physicists to study new
                  aspects of the sub-atomic world. Weak measurements allowed researchers from the University of
                  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at the University of Rochester to prove Aharonov’s
                  discoveries concerning time.

                  In 2013, Aharonov, Popescu and others published a paper in the New
                  Journal of Physics finding that a photon and one of its properties – polarization – can exist
                  independently. They open the paper with a quote from Lewis Carroll’s 1865 novel Alice in
                  Wonderland: “All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the
                  end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
                  “Well! I&#39;ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice, “but a grin without a cat! It&#39;s
                  the
                  most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”

                <p class="theory-description">
                  In 2014, Aharonov, Struppa, Tollaksen and others proved that if
                  pigeons were the size of atoms, three could fit in two pigeonholes and never share the same
                  space. Showing that the result of an experiment is not determined from the beginning raises the
                  possibility that the future will influence the past. A 2016 paper from the team won the Cozzarelli
                  Prize from the National Academy of Sciences for best paper of the year.

                  In collaboration with Struppa and others, Aharonov found in 1989 that
                  low-energy light emits strong, high-energy waves of light if glimpsed through a tiny opening.
                  “This has amazing potential for use in microscopy, where you would need very high-frequency
                  light to distinguish between two atoms very close together,” Struppa says. “It’s very exciting. I
                  still remember when Yakir first proposed it in my backyard after dinner with a group of
                  mathematicians and physicists. We opened a bottle of good Scotch, Yakir puffed on his cigar and
                  we brought out easels and white boards. Yakir has the unique ability to explain profound new
                  concepts in simple, low-tech ways that allow others to contribute. And he has a way of re-
                  explaining something, as you work on it for months or years, that looks at an idea from a slightly
                  different angle every time so you start to see the shape of it. His mind is like a diamond – he cuts
                  to the core of things without the dust of technical details you don’t need at first.”

        Aharonov is talking about the past, the present and the future.
        “I’ve been thinking big questions about time and the universe since I was a
        child, as all children do. I just never stopped, and my parents encouraged my
        work,” he says. Now, he finds himself turning more often to a question on
        the human scale. “If effects from the future determine what I do in the
        present, such as in the movie ‘Back to the Future,’ do I have free will?” he
        asks. “I believe we do. Nature protects freedom of choice. Einstein was
        troubled by the uncertainty he saw in physics and said God doesn’t play dice
        with the universe. I’ve asked instead why God would play dice – what is
        gained? We’re finding this uncertainty is what protects free will. Freedom of
        choice is at the core of things.”

        Justin Dressel doesn’t exactly fit the profile of a revolutionary. But make no mistake, he wants Chapman
        University at
        the front lines of an emerging battleground in quantum technology. That’s because research in this realm could
        transform information processing, affecting critical areas of the economy and national security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent reports detail China’s ambitions for global leadership in quantum technology. A new “space race” is
        developing, and the United States is at risk of falling behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If the potential of this technology is realized and we aren’t leading the charge as a nation, it could have
        disastrous
        consequences for data security and the tech sector,” says Dressel, Ph.D., associate professor and program
        director
        for the physics faculty at Chapman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Congress is concerned enough that in December 2018 it funded the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), seeking to
        empower academic and industry research partnerships – “to bring us out of our caves to more explicitly work
        together,” Dressel says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chapman is partnering with other Southern California institutions in hopes of answering this call to
        collaborate.

        Where Theory Meets Application
      </h3>
      <p>
        Dressel’s contribution is particularly important because his research straddles the worlds of quantum theory
        and
        experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Each group speaks a different language, so a certain amount of translation is required,” Dressel says. “I
        speak
        both languages,
        which greases the wheels for productive collaboration.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The working group, known for now as Quantum LA, includes schools such as USC, UCLA and Caltech. If the
        collaborative lands National Science Foundation funding, it will become one of just five or six such
        NSF-funded
        NQI
        centers nationally, Dressel says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many hurdles remain, but the initiative’s goal is clear: to fully explore the potential of quantum technology
        to
        revolutionize communication, sensing and computing. This is a critical time, Dressel notes, because the speed
        of
        conventional computation has started to plateau.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We’ve miniaturized to the point where we can’t go much smaller – computer processors and transistors are
        bumping
        up against atomic scale,” he says. “We have to use the entire theory of quantum mechanics, not the simplified
        version
        we’ve used up to this point.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum computing offers the potential for previously unattainable speed and for solving vexing problems, like
        simulating the structure of complex molecules. At the same time, quantum communication could reshape the world
        of data security.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What happens if a country can hack into any other government on the planet?” Dressel asks. “We had better be
        the
        first to develop counter technologies.”
